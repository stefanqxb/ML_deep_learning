Issue:

Attempting to use uninitialized value beta2_power tensorflow

Solution:

The problem is that you call model.optimizer.minimize too late.
This methods creates additional tensors within your graph, so calling it within a loop is bad idea
That's why you get exception you described - your initializer runs before you create them.
The solution for you will be to place call to model.optimizer.minimize within the model class itself, and store its result in model`s attribute.
